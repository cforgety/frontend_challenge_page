# Frontend Challenge

When it came to recreating the design I had developed through the Visual Challenge into an html/css format, there was much to learn, and needing to work through trial and error to achieve a look I was happy with delivering.

Learning to organize my html/css was a challenging, yet fun experience that is easy to see how improtant it is to keep simple, efficient, and easy to read.

My first challenge was needing to figure out where everything needed to go in the first place. Organizing my html with the basic "header", "main", "footer" format definitely aided in the process. Even with this, I ended up rather <div> heavy, which isn't all that pretty, and difficult to read, but at that the time, that was the only solution I really knew. 
  
The scrollable container that holds the bus info is an example of too many "div" elements in my html. It was pointed out to me that putting that info into a "table" could help clean up the html, in which it did beautifully.  Discovering better solutions such as that proved to be a great learning tool, and very welcome input.
  
  I still face issues mind you. When concerning the table information, not everything lines up the way I would like them to. Adjusting the widths in each "class" will help in some areas, but affect other areas. 
  
 An overall issue I tend to have when working with html/css, I can play around with things all I want, and end up making things "look" right. But my concern is not knowing the "right" way of editing things the way they more or less should.
 
 An example I have in my head is more of a "real world" application. I can space things and adjust the width correctly with the information I have available to me, making it all fit together, but thinking of other destinations (with longer names) in the hypothetical future populating in the app, and its affect on how the information is displayed troubles me.
 
 All of this could just be my ignorance on how it all works, but these are more or less the type of concerns that develop in my mind when working with html/css. "Is there a better way, am I doing it right?"
